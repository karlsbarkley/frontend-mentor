## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got more familiar with using media queries to adjust content based on mobile. I also built this with a mobile-first approach.


### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable using a hybrid approach with CSS Grid & Flexbox. I read this medium article and found it helpful
https://blog.bitsrc.io/css-flexbox-vs-grid-layout-5ae41e28d1d2
I would like to continue practicing and get more familiar with best approaches to responsive design

### Useful resources

- [Griddy](https://griddy.io) - This helped me understand the grid system. I could customize the layout on there & iterate for the media query. This
  helped me better understand where to start & know what features are out there.
